# CAnD3_project1_research_reproducibility
This project, conducted as part of the CAnD3 training on research reproducibility, evaluates the relationship between sex and the rates of divorce and separation in Canada, utilizing data from the 2017 Canada General Social Survey. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive and transparent analysis workflow that facilitates the complete reproduction of the study's results.
